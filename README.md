### General Info
***
This is a project that seeks to imitate the behavior and environment of a simple shell in such a way that it emulates its operation and logic. Understanding everything as a puzzle, where we work to strengthen each piece in a rigorous way and then unite them and get to move in the shell environment created by ourselves.

What you should learn from this project:

- Create a shell environment.
- Apply various functions to a large project.
- The complexities of making a simple shell.
- Manage lots of files and find a good workflow.
- reinforce teamwork skills.
