.SH NAME
    	Simple Shell - A simple UNIX command interpreter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "shel.h
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a UNIX command line interpreter based on the simple shell(sh).
It reads user input from the command line, interprets it, and executes commands.

In this project we want to emulate the Shell command interpreter,
which allows the user to communicate with the kernel through instructions,
which in turn allows them to be executed, on the other hand it allows access
to tools that allow controlling the operation of the computer.

.br
	wait - a program that demmans a child process to finish its execution before beginning a new one.

.br
	environment - a variable that holds all the c programs.

.SH RETURN VALUE
    	0 succes for normal process termination.
